# Ctrl-Shift-Product

It is of vital importance to have a visually actractive product and so Ctrl-Shift-Product tries to help brands achieve this.
All of the information that is all over the label that a lot of times ruins the aesthetic of a product can be replaced by a small
QR code.

This QR code can be read by our app utilizing a smartphone camera and display all the information.
This allows for a lot more information to be presented to the customer (for example full tables of nutrition values on food products).
You can also check your history of previously scanned items.
